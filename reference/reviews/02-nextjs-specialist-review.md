# Next.js Specialist Review: GlueOS Design System

**Review Date:** February 10, 2026
**Quality Assessment:** 7.5/10

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Well-structured Next.js 16 + Turborepo monorepo with solid App Router fundamentals. Excellent use of modern tooling (Server Components, dark mode, sophisticated data-table). **Critical configuration inconsistencies** between the two apps and several production-readiness gaps.

---

## APP: apps/web (Main Application)

**Purpose:** Demo/reference application with complex dashboard layout
**Maturity:** Advanced — uses modern patterns effectively

- Next.js 16.1.5 with App Router
- `transpilePackages: ["@repo/ui"]` for shared UI consumption
- Implements proper theme system (next-themes + CSS variables)
- Sophisticated components (DataTable with dnd-kit, charts with Recharts)
- Client components properly marked with "use client"

## APP: apps/docs (Documentation)

**Purpose:** Minimal documentation site (template-like)
**Maturity:** Incomplete

- Next.js 16.1.5 with App Router
- Uses localFont instead of next/font/google (inconsistent)
- **Missing** transpilePackages configuration
- **Missing** dark mode / theme support
- Serves as example app, not production documentation

---

## CRITICAL ISSUES

### CRITICAL-1: Metadata Configuration

Both apps have boilerplate metadata:
```typescript
title: "Create Next App",
description: "Generated by create next app",
```
For a generator tool, generated projects will inherit this placeholder.

### CRITICAL-2: Docs App Missing transpilePackages

`apps/docs/next.config.js` has NO `transpilePackages: ["@repo/ui"]`. Import of @repo/ui is fragile without this.

### CRITICAL-3: Font Configuration Inconsistency

- Web app: `next/font/google` (Geist, Geist_Mono)
- Docs app: `next/font/local` with manual font files

Both should use `next/font/google` for consistency.

### CRITICAL-4: Dark Mode Missing in Docs

Web app has full dark mode via next-themes + providers. Docs app has NO theme support — uses hardcoded CSS with `@media (prefers-color-scheme)`.

---

## IMPORTANT ISSUES

### IMPORTANT-1: Missing Per-Page Metadata

Dashboard layout has no per-page metadata. Important for SEO and browser tabs.

### IMPORTANT-2: useIsMobile Hydration Issue

`apps/web/hooks/use-mobile.ts` — returns `!!isMobile` which converts `undefined` to `false` during SSR, causing potential hydration mismatches. Should return `isMobile` directly and handle `undefined` in consumers.

### IMPORTANT-3: Missing Error Boundaries

No `error.tsx` or `loading.tsx` files in the dashboard route. Should add error boundaries and loading states.

### IMPORTANT-4: Color System Not Generator-Ready

CSS variables are hardcoded to OKLch values. For the generator, colors need to be injectable via configuration.

### IMPORTANT-5: Button appName Prop in Docs

`apps/docs/app/page.tsx` passes `appName="docs"` to Button, which isn't in the Button type definition. Dead code.

---

## NICE-TO-HAVE

1. **Parallel Routes** — could improve dashboard layouts
2. **Intercepting Routes** — better modal/drawer UX
3. **Component Manifest** — centralized component documentation
4. **Code Splitting** — dynamic import for heavy components like DataTable
5. **Environment Config System** — no way to configure app behavior per environment

## SCORING

| Aspect | Score |
|--------|-------|
| App Router Usage | 9/10 |
| Server/Client Boundary | 8/10 |
| Component Architecture | 8.5/10 |
| Configuration | 6/10 |
| Metadata & SEO | 5/10 |
| Error Handling | 4/10 |
| Dark Mode | 7/10 |
| Styling | 9/10 |
| Performance | 7/10 |
| Documentation | 4/10 |

---

## CRITICAL PATH

**Must Fix:** Fix apps/docs config, injectable color system, error boundaries, metadata
**Should Fix:** Per-page metadata, useIsMobile hydration, dark mode in docs, component inventory
**Nice to Have:** Parallel routes, code splitting, performance monitoring
